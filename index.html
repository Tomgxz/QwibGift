    every month send a dodecahedronal cardbord object
    has a puzzle on top
    
    Dodecahedron is one of only five Platonic solids. This is a regular polyhedron with 20 vertices, 30 edges, and 12 faces. All faces are regular pentagons and at every vertex meet three faces and three edges. The other Platonic solids are tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, cube.
    
    if you complete the puzzle, you can open it up and recieve the slew of prizes inside
    
    if you put in reffereal QUIBFAP 
    get 15% off next three months
    
    never know whats inside
    
    if you sign up with a non sock account and use code QUIBFAP, you get a sock account!
    
    it could be a normal sock, a stocking, nice thick hiking sock (dont wanna slip on this), a cotton sock, a blend of socks (not biblically moral), also toeless socks
    
    if you sub for two months, you get the pair!
    
    its a new fashion sign - qwibgift are getting in early
    you know those ripped jeans that look terrible?
    and they are very expenisve?
    and they sport them around as if to be proud of themselves?
    
    imagine that but for socks
    they have a spongebob one
    
    and the hits dont stop
    
    for every toeless sock that is given to you through qwibgift, they will donate five of the cut-off toe bits from the sock 
    to the ugundaan foot children fund. So you can cover the toes of ugandan children and (a large part of) your feet warm and snug
    
    because the sock-toes are so small, they wear out pretty quickly, so some fo the orphans only have four or three, or god forbid two
    at that point they dont wanna look embarrasing so they dont even put them on. So, its a constant cycle of storing and replacing
    these sock-toes. Because the ugandan orphans have such big hearts, they will donate their two to someone else who only has three,
    so that the other person can be happier - at least someone can have a full set. They got big hearts. And thats what halloween / christmas
    (cross out as nessecary) is all about.
